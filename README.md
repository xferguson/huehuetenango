# huehuetenango
A quick experiment in visualizing my synaesthesia.

Huehuetenango is a quick "art project" I did for a friend in the Spring of 2013 as a way to express my synaesthetic experience and how it affected my experience of one of his [coffee roasts](http://feistygoatcoffee.com).

It has been in my mind lately, and I have been thinking of ways I may do other digital explorations of my experience. This repo is a record, and a reminder.
